    "1. Prices: What are the prices (per lure) for each fishing lure at each retailer?\n",

    "   (If there is no inventory limit, enter a large value greater than the quantity desired, e.g. 100.)\n",
    "1. Shipping: how much does shipping cost at each retailer, if your order is below the threshold for free shipping? (E.g., you must pay \\\\$4.00 for shipping at Retailer 2, unless you qualify for free shipping.)\n",
